# C++ Project 1 Description
You’re working on a GPS application which lets the user record the coordinates of places they
want to revisit. For example, a user might record the location of nice places to take pictures
while on a hike. A location’s coordinates are a pair of integers X and Y.

Main Method:
● Use two arrays to store up to 10 x-coordinate values and 10 y-coordinate values.
● Let the user choose from one of the following options:
1) Store a new location
2) Remove a location
3) Show stored locations

Option 1 must let the user enter the X and Y coordinates of a point of interest.
Option 2 must let the user choose which point of interest they want to remove. The coordinate
pair the user selected must be removed from the storage arrays.
Option 3 must display all the coordinates that have been stored. It must not display any
coordinates the user chose to remove.

# C++ Project 2 Description
Design a C++ program which meets the following requirements. You may write code to test
your ideas, but this project is intended to exercise the Object-Oriented Programming principles
we discussed in class. Do not submit a program design which uses fewer than 2 classes.
Remember that you are designing data types used in the construction of your program. Each
class should have a single purpose, either storing information or using information to perform a
task. You may use either inheritance or composition to add functionality to your classes.

Goal:
A client would like a program which helps them follow recipes in the kitchen and create new
recipes when they try cooking something new.

Requirements:
The program must:
● Store the ingredients used in each recipe, including their names and amounts required.
● Store instructions for completing the recipe step by step.
● Allow the user to create new recipes.
● Allow the user to browse the available recipes and required ingredients.
● Allow the user to follow a recipe step by step.
○ Must show each step of the recipe in order -- not all at once.

# C++ Project 3 Description
Write a C++ program which allows the user to record a series of 2D coordinates (pairs of X and
Y values) representing the user’s location while traveling. At least two classes must be used to
construct the program. The program must let the user:
1) Add a new location (i.e. store a new pair of coordinate values)
2) View the total distance traveled
3) View the distance to a given point (input by the user)

# C++ Project 4 Description
Implement the following data structures in C++ without using the Standard Template Library.
The classes implementing each data structure must be generic, i.e. using templates to store
variables of any ordered type.
1) Stack
2) Linked List
3) Queue
4) Heap
